There is only one source code file.  I intend to keep it
like that.  If it gets big enough to require multiple
source files someone else will have to take it over.

I presume you kave a 'C' compiler and know how to use it.
If you don't you are reading the wrong file and I can't
help you.

1) Decompress the 'tar' ball (zip file) into a directory
where you can compile it.

2) At the command prompt:
    $>gcc chaffer.c

    If your using a different C compiler run it instead.
    $>cc chaffer.c

    You have now built all three of the programs which are
    part of this package.  They are all in the file named
    'a.out', which you will find in the directory where you
    compiled it.

3) The easiest way is to just copy the a.out file to three
    new names.  Copy it to 'winno', 'chaff', and 'grill' or
    'winno.exe', 'chaff.exe', and 'grill.exe' if your system
    preferrs that flavor.  There are other ways to do this,
    just make sure all three of the files are executeable.

That's it you're done.  If you want you can move them to
directory in your path or stick them elsewhere on your
system where other's can run them, but that's it, 
"Bob's your uncle."
